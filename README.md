A collection of my completed projects showcasing my skills in data science.

## Lab Experiment Database and User Interface

This project is designed to streamline the management of lab experiments at Northeastern University. It involves creating a comprehensive database to track various laboratory components, including chemicals, reactants, labs, equipment, researchers, and experiments.

### Features:
- **Chemical Management**: Store and retrieve information about different chemicals, their properties, and reactivity.
- **Reactant Tracking**: Keep track of available reactants, their amounts, and expiration dates to ensure safe and effective usage.
- **Laboratory Information**: Manage details about different labs, including location and department affiliations.
- **Equipment Oversight**: Maintain records of lab equipment and their corresponding lab locations.
- **Researcher Data**: Track researchers associated with each lab and their roles in experiments.
- **Experiment Management**: Create and monitor experiments, linking them with the necessary chemicals and equipment.
- **Procedural Support**: Implement stored procedures to manage reactants and experiments efficiently.

### Tech Stack:
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Development Tools**: JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), SQL
- **Environment**: Local MySQL Server

This project enhances the organization and efficiency of lab operations, ensuring that all necessary components are easily accessible and properly documented.
